Analysis Performed
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used to classify customer reviews as Positive (1) or Negative (0).
The model was trained using labeled data and evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Key Findings
Model Performance
Accuracy: 76% â€” the model correctly classified 152 out of 200 reviews.

Precision & Recall:
Negative class (0): Precision = 0.79, Recall = 0.67
Positive class (1): Precision = 0.74, Recall = 0.84
The model performs slightly better in detecting positive reviews.

Confusion Matrix Insights
True Positives (89): Positive reviews correctly predicted.
True Negatives (63): Negative reviews correctly predicted.
False Positives (31): Negative reviews were wrongly predicted as positive.
False Negatives (17): Positive reviews were wrongly predicted as negative.

Conclusion
The model shows good overall performance, especially in recognizing positive sentiment.
